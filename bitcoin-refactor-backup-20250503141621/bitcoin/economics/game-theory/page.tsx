                "When I designed Bitcoin, I faced a fundamental challenge: how to create a
                decentralized monetary system that would remain stable without a central authority.
                Traditional currencies rely on trusted third parties and legal frameworks to enforce
                rules, but Bitcoin had to operate in a trustless environment where participants
                might act in their own self-interest, potentially at the expense of the system."
              </p>
              <p>
                "Game theory provided the solution. By carefully aligning economic incentives with
                the security of the network, I created a system where rational participants find it
                more profitable to follow the rules than to attempt to subvert them. The mining
                reward, transaction fees, proof-of-work difficultyâ€”these aren't arbitrary design
                choices, but carefully calibrated mechanisms that create a Nash equilibrium where
                honest behavior is the dominant strategy."
              </p>
              <p>
                "The brilliance of this approach is that Bitcoin doesn't require participants to act
                altruistically. It assumes they will act in their own economic self-interest, and
                then harnesses that self-interest to secure the network. In this way, the invisible
                hand of incentives guides individual miners toward actions that benefit the
                collective, creating a system that is both decentralized and remarkably stable."

                As the visualizer demonstrates, honest mining offers consistent, positive expected returns proportional to the miner's hash power. Conversely, most attack strategies (like trying to mine invalid blocks or executing a 51% attack) are extremely costly, have a low probability of success, and often undermine the value of the very asset the attacker seeks to gain. This makes rational economic actors strongly prefer honest participation.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Bitcoin's reliance on game theory is one of its most revolutionary aspects. Instead
                of depending on a central authority or trusted intermediaries, it creates a
                self-regulating system where the collective good emerges from individual
                self-interest. This alignment of incentives is what allows Bitcoin to function as a
                decentralized, secure, and censorship-resistant network.

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                For the first time in history, Bitcoin created a monetary system that doesn't
                require trusted third parties or central authorities. No single entity,
                corporation, or government controls the Bitcoin network. Instead, it operates by

                rules globally.

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                Unlike any previous form of money, Bitcoin has a mathematically guaranteed fixed
                supply. The protocol limits the total supply to exactly 21 million bitcoins. This
                supply schedule is enforced by code that anyone can verify, creating the first
                truly scarce digital asset. The mining reward halves approximately every four
                years, with the final bitcoin projected to be mined around the year 2140.

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                Bitcoin is open to anyone with internet access. There are no gatekeepers, identity
                requirements, or approval processes. Anyone can create a wallet, receive, store,
                and send bitcoin without asking for permission. This financial inclusion is
                revolutionary for the billions of people worldwide who lack access to traditional
                banking services.

                Every Bitcoin transaction ever made is recorded on the public blockchain. This
                radical transparency allows anyone to independently verify the current state of
                the system and its history without trusting any third party. The rules can be
                verified by anyone running a full node, ensuring that no inflation beyond the
                schedule or invalid transactions can occur.

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                Once confirmed, Bitcoin transactions become practically irreversible. Each
                subsequent block adds exponentially more security through proof-of-work, making
                the blockchain an immutable record. This immutability creates settlement finality
                without courts, contracts, or custodiansâ€”a property previously impossible in the
                digital realm.

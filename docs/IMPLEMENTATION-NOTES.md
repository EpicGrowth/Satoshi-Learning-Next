## Brand Voice Guidelines Integration

The redesign incorporates the Satoshi Station brand voice throughout the UI:

- Direct, jargon-focused language that prioritizes accuracy
- Raw, unfiltered presentation of Bitcoin concepts
- Educational focus that empowers without being paternalistic

## Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Component Library**:
   - Keep components modular and well-documented
   - Maintain a consistent interface for all Bitcoin-specific components

2. **Theme Updates**:
   - Any color or typography changes should be made in the theme system
   - Avoid inline styles that bypass the design system

3. **Content Strategy**:
   - Regularly review and update educational content
   - Maintain technical accuracy as Bitcoin evolves

4. **User Feedback**:
   - Implement a feedback system for educational content
   - Track common user pain points and address them

## Technical Notes

- The site uses Next.js with App Router
- Styling is handled through Tailwind CSS with custom Bitcoin-themed extensions
- Components follow the Radix UI primitive pattern for accessibility
- Learning progress is stored in localStorage for persistence

Remember to run `npm install` after pulling these changes to get all the new dependencies needed for the redesign.

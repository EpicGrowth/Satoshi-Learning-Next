# Satoshi Station Verification Tools

## Overview

The verification tools in Satoshi Station allow users to independently verify Bitcoin and Lightning Network data, aligning with the core Bitcoin philosophy of "Don't Trust, Verify." These tools provide both educational value and practical utility.

## Tools Implementation

### 1. Block Explorer (`/verify/blocks`)

The Block Explorer allows users to search for and verify Bitcoin blocks by height or hash.

#### Features

- Search for blocks by height or hash
- View detailed block information
- Verify Merkle root calculations
- Navigate between blocks
- View transaction lists
- Transaction details with input/output analysis
- Fee calculation and visualization
- Mempool status integration

#### Implementation

- Frontend: React components in `/src/app/verify/blocks/`
  - `BlockExplorer.tsx`: Main explorer component
  - `BlockDetails.tsx`: Detailed block view
  - `TransactionList.tsx`: Block transactions
  - `MerkleVerification.tsx`: Interactive Merkle tree visualization
  - `MempoolStatus.tsx`: Real-time mempool information

- API Integration:
  - REST endpoints in `/src/app/api/bitcoin/blocks/`
  - WebSocket connection for real-time updates
  - Rate limiting and caching implementation
  - Multiple node fallback system

- Data Sources:
  - Primary: Self-hosted Bitcoin Core node
  - Fallback: Blockstream API
  - Mempool.space API for fee estimates

### 2. Digital Signatures (`/verify/signatures`)

Tools for verifying cryptographic signatures and creating signed messages.

#### Features

- Message signing with Bitcoin addresses
- Signature verification
- Support for legacy and native SegWit addresses
- Batch verification capability
- Integration with hardware wallet signing
- Educational visualizations of the signing process

#### Implementation

- Frontend Components:
  - `SignatureVerifier.tsx`: Main verification interface
  - `MessageSigner.tsx`: Message signing interface
  - `AddressValidator.tsx`: Bitcoin address validation
  - `SigningProcess.tsx`: Interactive educational component
  - `BatchVerification.tsx`: Bulk signature verification

- Cryptographic Implementation:
  - Uses `bitcoinjs-lib` for core functionality
  - Custom implementation of Bitcoin message signing
  - Support for P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH addresses
  - Hardware wallet integration via WebUSB

- Security Measures:
  - Client-side only signing
  - No private key storage
  - Secure random number generation
  - Input validation and sanitization

### 3. Transaction Verification (`/verify/transactions`)

#### Features

- Raw transaction decoder
- Script analysis and verification
- Fee calculation and analysis
- Input/output visualization
- UTXO set verification
- RBF (Replace-By-Fee) detection
- Multi-signature transaction support

#### Implementation

- Frontend Components:
  - `TransactionDecoder.tsx`: Raw transaction parsing
  - `ScriptAnalyzer.tsx`: Script execution visualization
  - `UTXOVerifier.tsx`: UTXO set validation
  - `FeeAnalyzer.tsx`: Fee calculation and comparison
  - `RBFDetector.tsx`: RBF status checker

- Technical Implementation:
  - Transaction parsing using `bitcoinjs-lib`
  - Custom script interpreter for educational purposes
  - UTXO set verification against multiple nodes
  - WebSocket updates for mempool status

- Data Integration:
  - Bitcoin Core RPC for UTXO verification
  - Mempool.space API for fee comparisons
  - Blockstream API as fallback

### 3. Merkle Proofs (Planned: `/verify/merkle`)

Tools for verifying transaction inclusion in blocks using Merkle proofs.

#### Merkle Features

- Merkle tree visualization
- Proof generation
- Proof verification
- SPV validation

## Security Implementation

### API Credential Management

Credentials for external APIs are managed securely:

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Credentials stored in `.env.local` (not committed to version control)
   - Sample configuration in `.env.local.example`

2. **Production Environment**:
   - Credentials stored as GitHub Secrets
   - Passed to Cloud Run as environment variables during deployment
   - Accessed securely at runtime via environment variables

### Implementation Details

- Secret management utilities in `/src/lib/secrets.ts`
- API routes handle all external API communication
- No credentials exposed to client-side code
- GitHub Actions workflow configured to pass secrets to Cloud Run

## Adding New Verification Tools

To add a new verification tool:

1. Create a new directory in `/src/app/verify/[tool-name]/`
2. Implement the frontend components
3. Create API routes in `/src/app/api/[service]/[tool-name]/` if needed
4. Update the verification tools list in `/src/app/verify/page.tsx`
5. Document the tool in this file

## Lightning Network Verification (Future)

Future Lightning Network verification tools will include:

1. **Channel Verification**:
   - Verify channel existence and capacity
   - Check channel state and policies

2. **Node Information**:
   - Verify node connectivity and capacity
   - Check routing capabilities

3. **Payment Verification**:
   - Verify payment routes
   - Check fee calculations

These tools will be implemented using a combination of public Lightning Network APIs and optional self-hosted node connections.

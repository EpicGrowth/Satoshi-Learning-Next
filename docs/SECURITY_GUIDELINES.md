 # Security Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines security best practices for the Satoshi Station Next platform, focusing on protecting user data, ensuring secure Bitcoin operations, and maintaining platform integrity.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Secure storage of user credentials
- Regular security audits
- Data minimization practices

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Secure password policies

### 3. Bitcoin-specific Security
- Secure key management
- Transaction signing best practices
- Network security measures
- Wallet integration security

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Application Security

#### Authentication
- Implement OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- Enforce strong password requirements
- Rate limit authentication attempts
- Implement account recovery securely

#### Session Management
- Secure session handling
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- Cookie security headers

#### API Security
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- API authentication
- Rate limiting

### 2. Infrastructure Security

#### Server Security
- Regular security updates
- Firewall configuration
- Access control lists
- Monitoring and logging

#### Network Security
- TLS 1.3 enforcement
- HTTPS only
- Secure DNS configuration
- DDoS protection

#### Database Security
- Encryption at rest
- Access control
- Backup security
- Query parameterization

### 3. Bitcoin Integration Security

#### Wallet Security
- HD wallet implementation
- Secure key storage
- Transaction signing security
- Address validation

#### Network Integration
- Secure RPC configuration
- Node security
- Network validation
- Mempool monitoring

## Current Security Implementation

### 1. Client-Side Security
- All cryptographic operations performed client-side
- No private key storage
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS prevention through React's built-in protections

### 2. API Security
- Rate limiting on verification endpoints
- Input validation on all API routes
- Error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- CORS configuration for API endpoints

### 3. Data Security
- No sensitive data storage
- Local storage only for progress tracking
- Client-side verification of Bitcoin transactions
- Secure communication with block explorers

## Security Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Next Release)
- Implement proper API credentials
- Add automated dependency scanning
- Set up security headers
- Enable rate limiting

### Phase 2 (Future)
- Add SAST/DAST testing
- Implement continuous security monitoring
- Create incident response plan
- Set up automated vulnerability scanning
- Escalation paths
- Recovery procedures

### 2. Monitoring & Detection
- Security monitoring
- Alert configuration
- Log analysis
- Anomaly detection

### 3. Recovery & Learning
- Incident documentation
- Post-mortem analysis
- Security improvements
- Knowledge sharing

## Compliance & Documentation

### 1. Compliance Requirements
- GDPR compliance
- CCPA compliance
- PCI DSS (if applicable)
- Local regulations

### 2. Security Documentation
- Security architecture
- Threat models
- Risk assessments
- Security procedures

  ```
- Indent code blocks with 2 spaces
- Include comments for complex operations
- Separate code sections with blank lines for readability

### Command Line Instructions
- Use `$` to indicate command prompt:
  ```
  $ bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
  ```
- Indicate user inputs with angle brackets:
  ```
  $ bitcoin-cli getnewaddress <label>
  ```
- Wrap output in code blocks without the prompt symbol

### Technical Diagrams

  - Nodes: Blue
  - Transactions: Green
  - Blocks: Orange
  - Signatures: Purple
- Include legend for all diagrams
- Maintain minimalist design with only essential elements
- Use directional arrows to indicate data flow

## Grammar and Style

### Numbers and Units
- Spell out numbers one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above
- Use numerals for all technical measurements and values
- Use commas as thousand separators (e.g., 1,000 BTC)
- Use period as decimal separator (e.g., 0.1 BTC)
- Use space between number and unit (e.g., 50 MB)

### Abbreviations and Acronyms
- Define acronyms at first use in each article
- Avoid unnecessary abbreviations in educational content
- Don't use periods in acronyms (e.g., US not U.S.)
- Use common Bitcoin abbreviations without definition (BTC, UTXO)

### Punctuation
- Use Oxford comma in series (e.g., "nodes, miners, and developers")
- Use em dash (â€”) without spaces for breaks in thought
- Use serial semicolons for complex lists
- Use colon to introduce lists, explanations, or examples
- Minimize exclamation points; use sparingly for genuine emphasis

### Capitalization
- Use sentence case for headings (capitalize first word and proper nouns only)
- Capitalize proper names of specific technologies (e.g., Taproot, Schnorr signatures)
- Do not capitalize generic technical terms (e.g., consensus algorithm, cryptography)

## Content Structure

### Educational Articles
- Begin with a clear problem statement
- Follow with a concise TL;DR summary
- Use hierarchical headings (H2, H3, H4)
- Include "Verification Steps" section where applicable
- End with "Next Steps" or "Learn More" section
- Keep paragraphs under 4-5 sentences

### Technical Tutorials
- Begin with prerequisites and difficulty level
- List required software/hardware
- Structure as sequential, numbered steps

### Definitions and Explanations
- Begin with concise, technical definition
- Follow with expanded explanation
- Include real-world analogies where helpful
- Connect concept to Bitcoin's fundamental principles
- Provide verification methods for conceptual claims

## Voice and Tone

### Technical Precision
- Prioritize accuracy over simplicity
- Be exact in describing technical processes
- Quantify claims when possible (e.g., "reduces validation time by approximately 15%")
- Avoid subjective qualifiers (e.g., "very fast," "much better")
- Cite sources or reference code for technical claims

### Accessibility
- Define technical terms at first use
- Use analogies to explain complex concepts
- Layer complexity gradually
- Break down processes into discrete steps
- Use visualizations to support technical explanations

### Verification Focus

#### Example: UTXO Concept Explanation
```
# Understanding Bitcoin UTXOs

## Definition
A UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) is an indivisible chunk of bitcoin locked to a specific owner and available for spending in future transactions.

## The Problem
Traditional financial ledgers track account balances, which creates synchronization challenges in distributed systems. Bitcoin needed a way to verify ownership and prevent double-spending without central coordination.

## How UTXOs Work
Rather than account balances, Bitcoin tracks unspent outputs from previous transactions. When you receive bitcoin, you're actually receiving an output locked to your key. When you spend, you consume entire UTXOs as inputs and create new outputs.

[Technical diagram showing TXID and output index structure]

## Verification
You can verify your own UTXO set by:
```bash
$ bitcoin-cli listunspent
```
This shows all UTXOs controlled by your wallet.

To verify the global UTXO set size:
```bash
$ bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo
```

## Practical Implications
The UTXO model has several important consequences:
1. Transactions consume existing UTXOs entirely, creating change when needed
2. Your "balance" is actually the sum of discrete UTXOs
3. Transaction size increases with the number of inputs
4. Privacy considerations vary depending on how UTXOs are combined

# Setting Up a Bitcoin Core Full Node

## Overview
This tutorial walks through the process of setting up a Bitcoin Core full node that independently validates all transactions and blocks. By the end, you'll have a functioning node that contributes to Bitcoin's decentralization and security.

## Prerequisites
- A computer with at least 350GB free disk space
- Broadband internet connection (2+ Mbps)
- Basic command line knowledge
- [Optional] External HDD for blockchain storage

## Difficulty: Intermediate
## Estimated Time: 2-3 hours (plus 1-3 days for initial sync)

## Step 1: Download Bitcoin Core
Download the latest version of Bitcoin Core from the official website.

```bash
$ wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/bitcoin-25.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

Verify the download using the provided signatures:
```bash
$ wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/SHA256SUMS
$ wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/SHA256SUMS.asc
$ sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
bitcoin-25.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz: OK
```

Further verification with GPG:
```bash
$ gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys 01EA5486DE18A882D4C2684590C8019E36C2E964
$ gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
```

## Step 2: Install Bitcoin Core
...

## Troubleshooting
### Problem: Node won't connect to peers
Check if your firewall is blocking port 8333. Run:
```bash
$ sudo ufw status
```
If port 8333 isn't allowed, add a rule:
```bash
$ sudo ufw allow 8333
```

### Problem: Disk space error during sync
...

## Verification
To verify your node is functioning correctly:

1. Check that your node is accepting connections:
```bash
$ bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo | grep connections
```
You should see a non-zero number of connections.

2. Verify blockchain sync status:
```bash
$ bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo | grep blocks
$ bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo | grep headers
```
When these numbers match, your blockchain is fully synced.
